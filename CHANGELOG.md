Changed

•CMM-3895 : a batch runs daily to save dfs data to database, ms content fetches the data and cmm-front will display the image based on stocks availability

•CMM-3476 : If it is an dfs part then we will not be calling speeder and plpr api also based on adv status we will be changing the icon display.

•CMM-3689 : Panier is exposing a new api and hence we will be consuming that api to show the price.
